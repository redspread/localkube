# Running rkt with an LKVM stage1

rkt has experimental support for executing pods with an [LKVM](https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/will/kvmtool/+/master/README) [stage1](devel/architecture.md#stage-1). rkt employs this [alternative stage1](devel/stage1-implementors-guide.md) to run a pod within a virtual machine with its own operating system kernel and hypervisor isolation, rather than creating a container using Linux cgroups and namespaces.

The "experimental" label denotes that the LKVM stage1 does not yet implement all of the default stage1's features and semantics. While the same app container can be executed under isolation by either stage1, it may require different configuration, especially for networking. However, several deployments of the LKVM stage1 are operational outside of CoreOS, and we encourage testing of this feature and welcome your contributions.

## Getting started

You can either use `stage1-kvm.aci` (or `stage1-lkvm.aci`) from the official release, or build rkt yourself with the right options:

```
$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure --with-stage1-flavors=kvm && make
```

For more details about configure parameters, see [configure script parameters documentation](build-configure.md).
This will build the rkt binary and the LKVM stage1-kvm.aci in `build-rkt-1.4.0+git/bin/`.

Provided you have hardware virtualization support and the [kernel KVM module](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Getting_the_kvm_kernel_modules) loaded (refer to your distribution for instructions), you can then run an image like you would normally do with rkt:

```

This output is the same you'll get if you run a container-based rkt.
If you want to see the kernel and boot messages, run rkt with the `--debug` flag.

You can exit pressing `<Ctrl-a x>`.

#### CPU usage
By default, processes will start working on all CPUs if at least one app does not have specfied CPUs.
In the other case, container will be working on aggregate amount of CPUs.

#### Memory
Currently, the memory allocated to the virtual machine is a sum of memory required by each app in pod and additional 128MB required by system. If memory of some app is not specified, app memory will be set on default value (128MB).

### Selecting stage1 at runtime

If you want to run software that requires hypervisor isolation along with trusted software that only needs container isolation, you can [choose which stage1 to use at runtime](https://github.com/coreos/rkt/blob/master/Documentation/subcommands/run.md#use-a-custom-stage-1).

For example, to use the official lkvm stage1:

```
# rkt run --stage1-name=coreos.com/rkt/stage1-kvm:1.4.0 coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.9
...
```

If the image is not in the store, `--stage1-name` will perform discovery and fetch the image.

## How does it work?

It leverages the work done by Intel with their [Clear Containers system](https://lwn.net/Articles/644675/).
Stage1 contains a Linux kernel that is executed under LKVM.
This kernel will then start systemd, which in turn will start the applications in the pod.

A LKVM-based rkt is very similar to a container-based one, it just uses lkvm to execute pods instead of systemd-nspawn.

Here's a comparison of the components involved between a container-based and a LKVM based rkt.

Container-based:

```
host OS
  └─ rkt
    └─ systemd-nspawn
      └─ systemd
        └─ chroot
          └─ user-app1
```


LKVM based:

```
host OS
  └─ rkt
    └─ lkvm
      └─ kernel
        └─ systemd
          └─ chroot
            └─ user-app1
```
